# Image-recognition-AI
For this project I wanted to experiment with AI tools, so I decided to make an image classification program that uses an open-source python library called imageAI specifically the MobileNetV2 model. With those tools I was able to make an image classification program that outputs the models top 3 guesses as to what is in the image and the respective probabilities

To use this program: 
1)	Type “pip install -r requirements.txt” into the command line.
2)	On the ImageAI website under image classification install the MobileNetV2 model 
3)	Download the pictures you want to classify into the same folder you download the code into.
